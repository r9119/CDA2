This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
library(lubridate) # simplifies working with dates
library(knitr) # tools to make nice outputs
library(plotly) # interactive plots
library(jsonlite) # to deal with json
library(mongolite) # to connect to mongodb
```

```{r}
oil_price_collection <- mongo(collection = "BrentOilPrice", db = "cda2")
oil_price <- as_tibble(oil_price_collection$find(query = "{}"))

oil_price %>% oil_price %>% filter(period >= "1990-01-01" & period <= "2018-12-31")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
